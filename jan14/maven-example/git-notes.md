## Git and Github

Git is a Version Control program that tracks differences between files within a repository.
A Repository is a particular directory that Git is collecting and tracking.

Github is a remote repository that you can commit your local repository to.
This allows for multiple people to work on an ever-changing repo.
It also has useful features for issue tracking and CI workflows with things like Github Actions.
